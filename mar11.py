Replit Day 5:
I learned how to write else statements.

print("What Avengers character are you?")
myHulk = input("Do you like to smash things?")
if myHulk == "yes":
  print("You are Hulk!")
else:
  print("You are not Hulk")

myIronMan = input("Do you like to fly?")
if myIronMan == "yes":
  print("You are Iron Man!")
else:
  print("You are not Iron Man")

myThor = input("Do you like to throw lightning?")
if myThor == "yes":
  print("You are Thor!")
else:
  print("You are not Thor")

myHawkeye = input ("Do you like to shoot arrows?")
if myHawkeye == "yes":
  print("You are Hawkeye!")
else:
  print("You are not Hawkeye")
