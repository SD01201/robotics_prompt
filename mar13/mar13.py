Today I learned how to make my own login program

Replit Day 6:
print("SECURE LOGIN")
username = input("What is your username?")
password = input("What is your password?")
if username == "Sam" and password == "Isuck":
  print("Welcome Sam!")
elif username == "Ambika" and password == "Bookman":
  print("Hey there Ambika!")
elif username == "Sanvi" and password == "Sandwich":
  print("Hi Sanvi!")
